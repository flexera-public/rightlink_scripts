Name: RightLink 10.5.3 Windows Base
Description: |
  Base ServerTemplate for RightLink10. RightLink10 is a new agent to connect
  servers to the RightScale platform that is very lightweight and simple to
  install. _It is not a plug-in upgrade from the older RightLink v6 or prior
  versions._ See [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl/about.html)
  for details.

  This base ST includes a few boot scripts that:

  * Wait for an EIP to settle (AWS only)
  * Sets up RightLink10 automatic upgrades
  * Enables RightScale OS monitoring.

  It has an operational script to force a RightLink10 upgrade. And we also
  provide a decommission script that provides the reason for shutdown. The
  source of the scripts on this ServerTemplate is available at
  [https://github.com/rightscale/rightlink_scripts/tree/10.5.3](https://github.com/rightscale/rightlink_scripts/tree/10.5.3).

  __Tested Windows distros:__

  * Windows Server 2012
  * Windows Server 2012R2

  __Tested compute clouds:__

  * AWS
  * Azure RM
  * Google Compute Engine
  * Softlayer
  * OpenStack

  __Tested use cases:__

  * Enable-Running
  * Custom-Image

  __This ServerTemplate is only meant to be used to enable existing servers or
  to boot up new custom created images via RightScale. It is not intended to be
  booted with the included images, they are only supplied as reference for what
  was used for validation.__

  The images included are stock/official images made available by the cloud
  provider or the OS developer. Therefore they can be deregistered and made
  unavailable at any time at the discretion of the owner. It is advised that you
  create your own MultiCloud Image with your own custom image for Linux or
  Windows. Please refer to [http://docs.rightscale.com/rl10/reference/rl10_os_compatibility.html#rightscale-tested-images](http://docs.rightscale.com/rl10/reference/rl10_os_compatibility.html#rightscale-tested-images)

  Some of the images included may require you to accept terms of service before
  using the image. Please follow the instructions provided in the error message
  during launch or refer to the OS compatibility link above.

  Clause: If RS/server.state == terminated for 1 minutes Then escalate critical
- Name: rs instance stranded
  Description: Raises an alert if the instance enters the stranded state.
  Clause: If RS/server-failure.state == stranded for 1 minutes Then escalate warning
- Name: rs instance not responding
  Description: It raises an alert if the instance fials to send monitoring information
    for 5 minutes.
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value == NaN for 5 minutes Then escalate critical
- Name: rs cpu busy
  Description: Raise an alert if the idle time is too low
  Clause: If cpu-0/cpu-idle.value < 15 for 3 minutes Then escalate warning
- Name: rs cpu overloaded
  Description: Raises an alert when the cpu idle time is too low.
